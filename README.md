## Getting started

### Prerequisites

What things do you need to install

```
Java SDK 11
Maven 3.6.0+
```

### Installation

- Clone Git repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/korostenskyiHub/Game-of-Basecamp.git
```

## Examples
- For fetching random character, you have to make HTTP POST request on:

```
$ curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/"
```

You should receive this JSON response:
```
{
    "status": "OK",
    "message": "1"
}
```

```"status"``` represents HTTP Response Code.

```"message"``` shows ```UUID``` in local database of fetched character.

The following methods (for example, ```fight``` etc.) need several characters, saved in local database. So, run this command multiple times.

- For showing all the content of local database use this HTTP GET request:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/?page=<Page Number>"
```

You can specify the amount of objects, got in JSON via specifying this number as optional request param ```pageSize```.

By default ```pageSize``` equals 5.
```
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/?page=<Page Number>&pageSize=<Amount of Objects>"
```

The output should be the following:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/?page=0&pageSize=2"

```"status"``` represents HTTP Response Code.

```"result"``` represents the array of ```Character``` objects.

- For making a fight between 2 characters, use the following:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/<UUID of First Character>?enemy=<UUID of Second Character>"
```

The output should be as following:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/1?enemy=3"

{
    "status": "OK",
    "message": "Aenys Frey (id: 1) from House Frey of the Crossing was fighting against Lancel Lannister (id: 3) from House Lannister of Casterly Rock on the place of House Nayland of Hag's Mire (id: 279) and was a winner"
}

**NOTE!**

If character DOES NOT have ```House```, application will consider it from ```"Unknown house"```

```
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/character/<Character Id>"
